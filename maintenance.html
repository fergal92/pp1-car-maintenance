                <h3>Engine oil</h3>            
                <ol id="engine-oil-list"><h5>To check your car's engine oil, follow these steps:</h5></ol>
                    <li>Prepare: Ensure your vehicle is parked on level ground, the engine is off, and it's cool.</li>
                    <li>Locate the Dipstick: Find the dipstick, usually near the front of the engine or in the engine bay.</li>
                    <li>Pull the Dipstick: Remove the dipstick, wipe it clean, reinsert it, then pull it out again.</li>
                    <li>Note Oil Level: Check the oil level on the dipstick; if it's between the minimum and maximum marks, it's fine.</li>
                    <li>Top Up if Needed: If the level is below minimum, add some oil using the correct type for your car, pouring it in slowly and checking the level with the dipstick to avoid overfilling</li>

                    <li>Ensure Engine is Cold: It's crucial to check the coolant level when the engine is cold to avoid burns from hot coolant</li>
                    <li>Locate Coolant Reservoir: Find the coolant reservoir under the hood, usually marked with "coolant" or specific symbols</li>
                    <li>Check Coolant Level: The reservoir is transparent with "min" and "max" markings; ensure the coolant level is between these marks</li>
                    <li>Top Up if Needed: If the coolant is below the "min" line, add a mix of coolant and de-ionized water in the correct ratio, typically 50-50, using a funnel to avoid spills</li>

                    <li>Operate Switch: Turn on the ignition (if necessary) and then turn on the headlight switch to the dipped beam position</li>
                    <li>Walk Around the Vehicle: Get out of the car to check that both the headlights and tail lights are working</li>
                    <li>Sequence to Follow: When checking the lights, go through the following sequence: side lights, dipped beams, main beams, fog lights, front indicators (left and right), brake lights, reversing lights, rear indicators (left and right), and hazard lights</li>
                    <li>Immediate Replacement: If any of your lights are faulty, ensure they are replaced immediately to maintain road safety</li>
