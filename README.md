# Car Maintenance Bible
Car maintenance bible is the go to guide for people wanting to know the basic tasks they can undertake to take care of their car and keep it in good running order. The site is easy to navigate and provides the essential information to the user. The site is targeted towards all car owners whether a first timer or a veteran of the road. 

The site offers a contact page to get in touch if the user's questions are not answered after visiting the site. 
The site landing page contains a link to a Top Gear article about the same car that is used for the hero image on the landing page. This article was used to apeal to car enthusiasts and keep them enjoying car related content rather than using a wikipedia article where their attention could get drawn in other directions. This was purposely chosen to ensure the website focused on car based content.

## Design
### Colours
I asked perplexity AI to suggest a good colour for a car maintenance website. It had varying suggestions. I settled on blue , red, white and silver as my colours of choice and used https://coolors.co/ to help pick the shade
```
/* CSS HEX */
international-klein-blue: #052ab0ff;  
white: #ffffffff;  
silver: #c0c0c0ff;  
fire-engine-red: #d5002eff;  
```
## Typography
I used Raleway and Montserrat as the fonts for the project. They are Sans Serif fonts. Perplexity AI suggested the use of these fonts for a car maintenance themed website. They worked well upon trial so I kept them. The fonts were found and imported from Google Fonts.

The Favicons were taken for free from this website https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/automobile

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using Blasamiq. First draft wireframes of the different pages as viewed on a laptop
